# Athena Boose

## Who I am

I'm a student currently studying Math and Computer Science (although I haven't ruled out swapping the former for either a Chemistry or a Physics major).

I take a particular interest in systems programming, as well as compilers and programming language design more generally. I'd like to delve more properly into embedded systems at some point in future, but there's only so much time in the day.

Much of my experience at this point is in C/C++, but I've dabbled in other languages as well. 
I know some Java and C#, enough to do cool things with, and enough Python to get by.

## Notes and acknowledgements

Many of the projects here are incomplete or partially complete. Unfortunately, I'm very busy right now, so things tend to get into a state of "does what I need it to do" and don't progress beyond that. Feel free to pester me to finish something or submit a PR yourself!

Some unfinished projects that I don't currently have plans to ever finish have been privated so as to not clutter my profile.
If you'd like access to one of these, email me and I'll make it public again!
