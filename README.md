## Current projects in active development (as of 14 Sept 2024)

[**cconvti**](https://github.com/chickenspaceprogram/cconvti) - A version of the earlier (and partially-complete) project convTI, rewritten in C because writing the original in Java was dumb. Converts text/CSV files to files usable on TI graphing calculators.

[**wordleTI**](https://github.com/chickenspaceprogram/wordleTI) - A program for playing Wordle on TI graphing calculators, written entirely in TI-BASIC.

## Who I am

I'm a university student studying Physics and Computer Science. I'm always interested in working on interesting projects, and my current interests in CS focus on scientific computing and low-level programming (as well as doing stupid things with graphing calculators). I don't currently have all that much in the way of proper career plans, as I don't really know what's out there. That being said, I would be interested in a career in Physics, Data Science, or as a Software Engineer, so I welcome any opportunities that are along those lines.
