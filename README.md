If you encounter bugs, issues, or find something that is incomplete that you think I should finish, please open a GitHub issue! I can't promise I'll get to it (I'm pretty busy at the best of times) but it helps to know what people are interested in!

Most of the stuff here is licensed under the MIT License, so you're free to use it in whatever way you want as long as I am credited.

## Current projects in active development (as of 14 Sept 2024)

[**cconvti**](https://github.com/chickenspaceprogram/cconvti) - A version of the earlier (and partially-complete) project convTI, rewritten in C because writing the original in Java was dumb. Converts text/CSV files to files usable on TI graphing calculators.

[**rusti**](https://github.com/chickenspaceprogram/rusti) - A version of cconvti, rewritten in Rust for the memes (and also because I like Rust)

[**wordleTI**](https://github.com/chickenspaceprogram/wordleTI) - A program for playing Wordle on TI graphing calculators, written entirely in TI-BASIC.
