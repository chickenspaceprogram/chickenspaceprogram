### Current projects in active development (as of 14 Sept 2024)

[**cconvti**](https://github.com/chickenspaceprogram/cconvti) - A version of the earlier (and partially-complete) project convTI, rewritten in C because writing the original in Java was dumb. Converts text/CSV files to files usable on TI graphing calculators.

[**wordleTI**](https://github.com/chickenspaceprogram/wordleTI) - A program for playing Wordle on TI graphing calculators, written entirely in TI-BASIC.
